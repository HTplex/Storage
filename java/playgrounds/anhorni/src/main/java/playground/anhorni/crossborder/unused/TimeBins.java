/* Remarks about the idea of using time bins:
 * We want to have all the plans starting time uniformly distributed in one hour
 * For a perfect uniform distribution we would have to know the exact number of plans in that hour
 * and for that we would have to make to loop in FMAParser.parse() twice.
 * Using time beens is a first work around and moves the gap given by the difference between totalVolume and 
 * number of plans into the time bins.
