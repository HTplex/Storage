Duncan,

Everything you should need to get started is now in three files:

- OSM2MATSim.java: The network transform from OSM to matsim.  The coordinate issue has NOT yet been fixed.

- MyControler2.java, which does everything else

- myconfig1.xml, which configures most (but not all) of MyControler2

Good luck

Kai
