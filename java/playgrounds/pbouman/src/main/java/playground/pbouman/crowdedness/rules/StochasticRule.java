/**
 * The general idea of the StochasticRule is that people may not sit down,
 * even if there are still (some) seats left.
 * 
 * The rule defines the probabilities in a piecewise linear fashion.
 * It behaves as follows:
 * 
 * If 0-50% of the seats are taken, the probability to get a seat is 1.
 * If 50-75% of the seats are taken, the probability to get a seat is 1 to 0.75.
 * If 75-100% of the seats are taken, the probability to get a seat is 0.75 to 0.
 * 
 * When someone leaves the vehicle and people are standing, the same procedure
 * is used to determine if someone will sit down. If someone sits down,
 * he is picked uniformly at random from the people who are standing.
