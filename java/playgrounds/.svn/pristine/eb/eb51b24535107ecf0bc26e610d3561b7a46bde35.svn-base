The field «VKJORFLT» gives the number of lanes and some properties. 

That would mean that the code 1#2#3K#4K#4H1  indicates two lanes in each direction, the outermost are reserved for public transport and the leftmost lane going in the opposite direction of the line on the map has to turn right, as far as I can understand.

 Ordinary lane 1
 lane for public transport 1K
 extra lane, ordinary 1O
 extra lane, toll booth 3B
 oppstilling, kollektivfelt 1OK
 Bomstasjon, kollektivfelt 1BK
 Bicycle lane 3S
 Forbikjoringsfelt 1F
