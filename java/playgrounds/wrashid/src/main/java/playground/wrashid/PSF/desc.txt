Change name of framework to TESF (Transportation Energy Simulation Framework) or 
MESF (Mobility Energy Simulation Framework).

Electric Mobility Simulation Framework (EMSF)


next:
- add general charging cases also...



===========
- TO START PSS:
1.) make results folder empty (a:\data\results
2.) copy initial prices to: a:\data\PSS\output\hubPriceInfo.txt (for input of MATSim) 
and a:\data\PSS\input\initialNodePriceInfo.txt (for input to PSS).

(example files (for hubPriceInfo.txt, initialNodePriceInfo.txt) you find in folder /wrashid/test/input/playground/wrashid/PSF/res/)


Notes:
======
- the price info file in an iteration folder are the input of MATSim and the
vehicle energy consumptions are the output of MATSim.
- in matlab set the file->path to the right folder, where the IVT_main_base etc. are in. and remove paths, from
other runs.
- use matlab 2008(b)





a:\scenario_uncongested\Multi_Manager_Network - > "data energy hub network.txt".
hub.trafo.maxinput.hub1 = 3; => d.h 2MW * 3 = 6MW
=> make this value higher, if need more power production.
