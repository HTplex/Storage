network
========
=> do not need any change.

=> specify this network file in the config.xml

facilities
==========
- use /wrashid/src/main/java/playground/wrashid/PSF/converter/scenario/Zurich.java to add parking facilities
(should be done, when also adding parking activities to the plans file. if done separatly, one can just load the facilities and 
invoke method for generating facities => TODO: separate the two steps).

=> specify this facilities file in the config.xml

plans
======
- probably you have a plans file mapped to a network. therefore you first need to remove the mapping using
/wrashid/src/main/java/playground/wrashid/lib/tools/plan/RemoveNetworkInformationFromPlan.java).

- After that, you can perform the mapping to a network. Just specify in a config the network, facilities and unmapped plans file and
run it for one iteration. You will find the output_plans.xml in the output folder, which is mapped to the specified network.
use /matsim/src/main/java/org/matsim/run/Controler.java for running controler.

- After that, use the /wrashid/src/main/java/playground/wrashid/PSF/converter/scenario/Zurich.java to add parking activities to the plans.

=> specify this plans file in the config.xml

hubLinkMapping
===============
- if you have a file, containing hub_Id and coordinate (for each subhub), then you can use 
/wrashid/src/main/java/playground/wrashid/PSF/data/hubCoordinates/hubLinkMapper/GenerateTableHubLinkMapping.java
to print on the console the hub to link mapping (specify, that the console should be redirected into a file).
-> remove top garbadage from file.
-> rename the log file, so that it contains the string ".mappingTable.", e.g. linkHub.mappingTable.txt

=> specify this mapping file in the config.xml under "main.hubLinkMappingPath"
