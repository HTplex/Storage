plans_3agents.xml

is a copy of

plans_hwh_1pct.xml

where all agents except for the first three agents have been removed.
Then, for two agents, all plan elements except the first acitivity and the subsequent leg, have been removed.
These two agents are considered for within-day replanning while the other one is just a normal agent.

===

This scenario is based on a demand as described in:

Rieser, M., K. Nagel, U. Beuck, M. Balmer and J. RÃ¼menapp (2007) Truly
agent-oriented coupling of an activity-based demand generation with a
multi-agent traffic simulation, Transportation Research Record, 2021,
10--17.

Following adaptations have been made:

- only persons with at least one car leg have been taken
- all activities other than work and education (edu) have been removed
- duration of all work/edu activities set to 8 hours.
- the first home activity for all agents ends at 8am 
- 1% subsample taken
